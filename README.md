Miscellaneous code that wouldn't fit in any other repository

* **redditvotes.py** - Calculates the total numbers of votes, upvotes and downvotes for a Reddit submission given the points and percent upvotes as listed on the Reddit website.
* **palindrome_recursion.py** - Recursively determines whether a given string is a palindrome (i.e. has the same characters forwards and backwards). I wrote this when I was just beginning to learn both Python and recursion.
* **tetration.py** - Recursively computes the output of tetration given two arguments - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration.
